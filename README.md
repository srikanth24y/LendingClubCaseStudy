# Lending Club Case Study
> A consumer finance company which specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers when receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant's profile. Lending loans to 'risky' applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). So the objective is to identify the risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e., the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilize this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.
